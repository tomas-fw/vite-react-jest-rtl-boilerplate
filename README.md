# React-Vite-Jest Boilerplate

This boilerplate project is designed to quickly set up a React app with Vite, Jest, and React Testing Library. This combination of technologies enables fast development, efficient testing, and a smooth developer experience.

## Motivation

Setting up a React application from scratch can be time-consuming and repetitive. This boilerplate project aims to provide a streamlined setup process that allows you to focus on building your app, rather than configuring the build environment.

1. **Vite**: Vite is a lightning-fast build tool and development server that offers a smooth developer experience. With its out-of-the-box features, it provides support for ES modules, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and a significantly faster development server compared to traditional tools like Webpack.

2. **Jest**: Jest is a popular testing framework that supports a wide range of test utilities, assertions, and mocking. It is widely used in the React community and is well-documented, making it easy to integrate into your workflow.

3. **React Testing Library**: React Testing Library is a lightweight testing library that encourages best practices for testing React components. It complements Jest by providing utilities for rendering and interacting with components during tests. Together, Jest and React Testing Library offer a powerful and user-friendly testing suite.

## Getting Started

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these simple steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash

```

```bash
